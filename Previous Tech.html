        <section>Neuralink is being developed based on technology that was created to help paralised patients. This technology enabled them to interact with computers, and control robotic arms with their minds among other things. The first person to have an implant in their brain  was named Mathew Nagle. He was able to do things such as move a mouse cursor, play pong (a simple video game), and move a robotic arm thanks to the implant. However, there were drawbacks of this implant. After a few months the sensors ability to read signals in the brain began to deteriorate, and each day the system would have to be recalibrated by professionals which could take up to half an hour. To top it all off, it was a very invasive surgery, and it left a huge hole in the top of his head where they would have to plug in a large cable everytime he used the system (Pollack). Neuralink has the potential to address these problems which I think will make it a viable commercial product in the future.</section>
