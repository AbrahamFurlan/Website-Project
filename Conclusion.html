        <section>While Neurlink might not become the final iteration of this technology, I have no doubt that it will become a become the catalyst that brings forth the new generation of technology. There certainly things to look out for when it comes to this new technology, but there are also many benefits and things to look forward to. While Neuralink may not be the first to create technology like this, they are certainly the best so far. I'm imagining a future where we can interact with the world around us on a level that we cannot even comprehend as of now. This technology makes me incredibly excited for what the future holds, and I can only hope that I will be able to stick around to see it.</section>
