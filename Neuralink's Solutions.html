            <section class="txt">Neuralink has developed a new BMI (Brain Machine Interface) that is designed to be
                minimally intrusive. Historically the threads that have been inserted into the brain have been stiff,
                and rigid which helps in penetrating the brain, but the problem with this is that it can elicit negative
                immune responses that limit the usability, and longevity of the devices. Neuralink uses thin, flexible
                threads that are less destructive, and also far more capable of reading data than previous BMI’s have
                been. The problem with this is that it becomes a lot more difficult to actually connect the threads to
                the brain. To solve this problem Neuralink has created a robot that can perform the surgery with
                incredible accuracy, while at the same time being capable of automatically inserting 6 threads per
                minute. During Neuralink’s study the surgery took 45 minutes on average (Musk). Neuralink designed the
                BMI in a way that won’t require another surgery if you want to update your hardwear. There is a small
                device that would sit behind your ear, which is the only thing that needs to be replaced when you want
                to upgrade your equipment. They plan on conducting human trials in 2020 on paralysis patients in an
                attempt to help them restore motor functions (Cold Fusion). Technologically I think that Neuralink is
                capable of making this technology commercially available (especially when looking at Elon Musk’s track
                record), but there are other problems with this technology.</section>
