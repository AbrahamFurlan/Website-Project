            <section class="txt">There are some people who are worried about the potential risks that Neuralink will
                introduce. In an article on Observer called “Mind-Reading Tech Is Dangerously Close to Becoming a
                Reality” the author brings up an interesting point, what happens when the technology inevitably gets
                hacked? People are already getting their pitchforks when facebook or some other social media site gets
                hacked and leaks private information, but what if your thoughts are leaked? Imagine marketers who are
                able to directly read your mind, and target specific ads at you depending on your mood. Or the
                government being able to actually control your mind (regardless of whether or not you are wearing a
                tinfoil hat). What if a company somehow manages to psychologically condition you to like their product
                more than others? There are clearly risks involved in this technology, and we need to do something to
                combat these risks.</section>
