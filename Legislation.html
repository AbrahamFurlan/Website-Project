            <section class="txt">How do we protect consumers from these problems if we want this technology to become
                mainstream though? There will obviously have to be some new laws put into effect in order to deal with
                such a radical technology like Neuralink. In an article by Vox called “Brain-reading tech is coming. The
                law is not ready to protect us.” the author, Sigal Samuel, interviewed Marcello Ienca, who suggested 4
                new kinds of laws that he thought should be put into effect. The first law was, “the right to cognitive
                liberty,'' essentially meaning that if you don’t want to use some sort of neural product you shouldn’t
                feel pressured to use it. I think that this would be an essential law, because otherwise companies could
                try to pressure employees to brainwash themselves to be loyal to the company, or else suffer limited
                career potential in the company. This would be an atrocious abuse of power, and if allowed humanity as a
                whole would likely suffer. The second law that Ienca suggested was “the right to mental privacy.” This
                is pretty obvious, and is similar to privacy laws that already exist, but I think that it should go much
                further than existing privacy laws. There should not be any way for companies to read your thoughts
                without your explicit permission, otherwise the whole idea of privacy would just become a joke. If we
                don’t have privacy in our minds, then we essentially don’t have privacy. The third law is “The right to
                mental integrity.” This is essentially the right to not be harmed by neural technology. Now this sounds
                pretty obvious, but what does it really mean? Basically, this would be protecting people from being
                brainwashed. Imagine being brainwashed into believing in a religion that you didn’t originally like, or
                to support a politician who you were originally wholeheartedly against. This is possibly one of the most
                important laws that would need to be created. The fourth, and final law that Ienca suggested was “The
                right to psychological continuity.” This protects you from alterations to your “sense of self” that you
                did not originally agree to. For example, a company making it so that you absolutely cannot live without
                their product. This can go hand in hand with brainwashing, but there are some subtle differences that
                make this an important distinction, such as preventing companies from targeting ads at you for something
                that you might not normally buy based on your neural patterns, and getting you to purchase it. If done
                correctly, these laws would be able to provide consumers with the minimum amount of necessary
                protection.</section>
