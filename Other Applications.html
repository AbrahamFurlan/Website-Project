        <section class="txt">I have gone in depth with a lot of technical stuff in this paper, so let’s get into some of the more fun stuff. What kind of changes can we expect this technology to bring us? You might have heard of the anime Sword Art Online (SAO), which is about people playing a video game where they are actually in the game. I believe that once this technology becomes sufficiently advanced then something like this will be possible. Another probable application from my point of view is with in regards to vehicles. Be it cars, airplanes, tanks, etc… Imagine getting real time feedback on the state of our vehicle such as how much gas you have, the speed you are going, what’s behind you, or where you should turn next to get to your destination. Our vehicles will become extensions of our bodies. What if you are able to download information into your brain instead of having to memorize it? Think times tables, or random historical names, this will make school much easier, and the old saying of “you won’t always have a calculator” will become somewhat laughable. There are so many changes that this technology could bring, and I couldn’t even begin to think of them all.</section>
